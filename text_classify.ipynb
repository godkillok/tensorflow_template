I have used Latent Dirichlet Allocation for generating Topic Modelling Features. LDA is an iterative model which starts from a fixed number of topics. Each topic is represented as a distribution over words, and each document is then represented as a distribution over topics. Although the tokens themselves are meaningless, the probability distributions over words provided by the topics provide a sense of the different ideas contained in the documents. "
